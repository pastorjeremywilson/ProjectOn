    <div>
        <p><strong>Order of Service</strong></p>
        <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/oos.png">
        <p>To the left, you have the <strong>order of service</strong> and <strong>media</strong> boxes.</p>
        <p>The order of service box is where you'll place your songs, scripture passages, etc., in the order they
        occur in your service. The order can be rearranged by dragging each item, or by using the arrows on the right.</p>
        <p>The media box is where your songs, bible, custom slides, images, and videos are stored. Drag, double-click, or
        click the <img src="resources/help/add_to_service_icon.svg" style="width: 20px; padding: 5px;"> icon to add an 
		item to the order of service.</p>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Preview Pane</strong></p>
        <img class="wrap" src = "resources/help/preview.png">
        <p>In the center of the screen, you have the <strong>preview</strong> box. This shows you how the currently
        selected order of service item will look when it goes "live."</p>
        <p>If an item has multiple slides - for example, a song or scripture passage - they will be listed in the
        upper portion of this box. In the bottom is a small preview of how the slide will look. Pressing
        <strong>space</strong> when any of the preview items are selected will send that item to "live."</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p><strong>Live Pane</strong></p>
        <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/live.png">
        <p>To the right, you have the <strong>live</strong> box.</p>
        <p>Whatever item is currently selected in this box will show on the display screen. Clicking on an item
        will make that item show on the display screen, and the arrow keys of the keyboard will also change
        what is being displayed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Up Arrow</strong>: Show the previous item</li>
            <li><strong>Down Arrow</strong>: Show the next item</li>
            <li><strong>Left Arrow</strong>: Show the previous item in the Order of Service</li>
            <li><strong>Right Arrow</strong>: Show the next item in the Order of Service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pressing the Down Arrow on the last item in this box will automatically show the next item of the Order
        of service. Likewise, pressing the Up Arrow on the first item in this box will automatically show the previous
        item of the order of service. This allows you to seamlessly navigate the entire order of service from
        this box.</p>
        <p>Note that the "live" box will also accept input from a PowerPoint remote control. Previous and Next
        slide buttons will perform the same functions as the up and down arrows. You should also be aware that
        this box needs to be "active" (have an item selected) in order for the PowerPoint remote to work.</p>
