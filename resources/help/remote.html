    <h1>Remote Web Pages</h1>
    <p>When the program is run, a local web server is run in the background. This server has three web pages: The first
    two are <strong>remote-control</strong> pages and the third is a <strong>stage view</strong> page. These web pages
    are served up as a website that can be accessed by any device connected to the same network as
    the computer running ProjectOn.</p>
    <p>The remote-control pages allow you to change what's showing on the projector without having to be right in front
    of the computer on which ProjectOn is running.</p>
    <p>The stage view page simply shows the lyrics or text of the current slide and is useful to use as a display for
    your musician(s).</p>
    <p>Access to these pages is accomplished through a web browser pointed to the IP address of the computer
    running ProjectOn and using ProjectOn's <strong>port: 15171</strong>. The two remote-control pages are located at:
    "<strong>/mremote</strong>", which is optimized for mobile devices, and one optimized for computers at "<strong>
	/remote</strong>". The stage view page is found at "<strong>/stage</strong>".</p>
    <p><strong>Too long, didn't read?</strong> The easiest way to find these addresses is by choosing "About" from 
	the "Help" menu. The program knows the IP addres of the computer it's running on, so this will show you the proper 
	addresses.<p>
    <p>But, let's see how to do this manually:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>On the computer running ProjectOn, find that computer's IP address. The quickest, easiest way to do this
        is to open your Windows menu by clicking the Windows Icon in your taskbar, and then typing in "cmd". Click on
        "Command Prompt" and a new window will open. There, type in "ipconfig" (without the quotes) and press "Enter".
        From the results that follow, find the "IPv4" address under either "Wireless LAN Adapter" or "Ethernet Adapter"
		depending on how the computer is connected to the internet. You can now close that window.
        </li>
        <li>
        Let's say that the computer's IP address is 192.168.0.4. The address you will type into the web browser in
        another computer or device will be "192.168.0.4:15171/" followed by the name of the page.
        </li>
        <li>So, to access the different web pages, you would type these addresses into your browser:<br />
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile-friendly remote</strong>: 192.168.0.4:15171/mremote</li>
                <li><strong>Regular remote</strong>: 192.168.0.4:15171/remote</li>
                <li><strong>Stage view</strong>: 192.168.0.4:15171/stage</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Both remote-control web pages have the same functions and layout. Across the top of the page you'll see four
    buttons on the left and two on the right. The four on the left perform these functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the previous item in the Order of Service</li>
        <li>Go to the previous slide</li>
        <li>Go to the next slide</li>
        <li>Go to the next item in the Order of Service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>while the two on the right perform these functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Show/Hide a black screen</li>
        <li>Show/Hide the logo screen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the black screen or logo screen is currently showing, clicking or tapping an order of service or slide
    item will hide them and show that item</p>
    <p>Clicking on any item on the left will show the first slide of that item, while clicking on any item on the right
    will show that particular slide. All lyrics and the text of scripture passages will show up on the right. This
    is particularly helpful if you are using the remote control from the pulpit or lectern.</p>
