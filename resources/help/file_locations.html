    <p>Below are the locations of files you may want to find.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Data Files</strong></p>
    <p>The database, configuration file, images, videos, and bibles are stored in the program's directory (usually
    C:\Program Files\ProjectOn or C:\Program Files (x86)\ProjectOn). There you will find a folder called "_internal"
    in which is another folder called "data". In this data folder are multiple folders and files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>backgrounds</strong>: A folder containing all the slide background images you have imported</li>
        <li><strong>bibles</strong>: A folder containing any XML bibles you have imported</li>
        <li><strong>images</strong>: A folder containing any images you have imported</li>
        <li><strong>videos</strong>: A folder containing any videos you have imported</li>
        <li><strong>projecton.db</strong>: The main program database, in SQLite format</li>
        <li><strong>settings.json</strong>: The program's settings file, in JSON format</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Device-Specific Settings</strong></p>
    <p>If the program has been installed on a shared drive or cloud folder, some settings are specific to the
    computer it is being run on. These are stored in a folder named "ProjectOn" under the "Roaming" Folder in the user's
    "AppData" folder. The file is named "<strong>localConfig.json</strong>" and is in the JSON format.</p>
    <p>This is most easily found by opening Windows' File Explorer and typing into the navigation bar,
    "<strong>%appdata%\ProjectOn</strong>" (without the quotes).</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Error Log</strong></st></p>
    <p>A log file is created by the program which tracks any errors that might occur while the program is running.
    Should you need to locate this file, it is found in the "ProjectOn" folder under the "Roaming" Folder in the user's
    "AppData" folder. It is named "<strong>error.log</strong>".</p>
