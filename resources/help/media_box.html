        <p>Now let's look a little closer at the media box.</p>
        <p>Here is where you can create and choose different media items for your services. Items include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Songs</strong>: The lyrics for hymns and praise songs</li>
            <li><strong>Bible</strong>: Scripture passages to be shown during the service</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Slides</strong>: Slides with your own text</li>
            <li><strong>Images</strong>: Any images you may want to show during the service</li>
            <li><strong>Videos</strong>: Any videos you may want to show during the service</li>
            <li><strong>Web Slides</strong>: Internet content you may want to show during the service</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>
        <p>Each of these tabs has a set of buttons you can use to perform various tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img class="icon" src="resources/help/add_icon.svg">Create a new item</li>
            <li><img class="icon" src="resources/help/add_to_service_icon.svg">Add this item to the Order of service</li>
            <li><img class="icon" src="resources/help/send_to_live_icon.svg">Send the item directly to "live" (without
            adding it to the Order of Service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, if the tab has a search box, use <img class="icon" src="resources/help/x_icon.svg">
        to clear the search box.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><strong>Context Menu</strong></p>
        <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/media_menu.png">
        <p>Right-clicking on an item in the Media Box will bring up a menu where you can add that item to the
        order of service, remove the item from the program or, in the case of songs and custom slides, edit the item.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><strong>A note about scripture passages...</strong></p>
        <p>The best way to use the <i>Bible</i> tab of the media box is to import your favorite bible
        version(s) and add them to the service through the "Enter Passage" box. However, if you would prefer not to
        import a bible, or if you would like to show a passage from a version you rarely use, simply paste the text of
        that passage into the lower box of this tab. <strong>Ensure that your pasted text includes verse numbers or this
        will not work as expected.</strong></p>
