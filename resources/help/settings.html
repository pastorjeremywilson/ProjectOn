    <h1>Settings</h1>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/settings.png">
    <p>Clicking the Settings button or choosing "Settings" from the menu will open the program's settings window.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>CCLI License</strong></p>
    <p>The top part of the settings window allows you to enter your CCLI license number (if you have one). This
    license number will show in the footer of any song lyrics you project.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Screen Settings</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/screen_settings.png">
    <p>The next part of the settings window allows you to specify which screen to use as the display screen. By
    default, the program places your display screen on your secondary monitor (Note: the display screen is hidden by
    default when the program is run on a computer with only one monitor). To move the display screen to a different
    monitor, select "Set as display screen" under your desired monitor. Changes will be reflected once the settings
    are saved.</p>

    <p><strong>Font Settings</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/font_settings.png">
    <p>Following this is the Font Settings area. This will set a global font face, size, and style for the program.
    A sample of the font is given for you and will reflect changes as you make them.</p>
    <p>Any fonts you currently have installed on your computer will show up in the "Global Font Face" dropdown. Note
    that plain, sans-serif fonts are usually easiest to read (Arial, Helvetica, etc.). To the right of this, you can
    set the global font size and the global font color. Clicking on "Custom" will open a window where you can choose
    a specific color for your font.</p>
    <p>Next is an option where you can apply a shadow effect to your font. Check the box if you want your font to have
    a shadow behind it. The two sliders allow you to change the "greyness" (black to white) of the shadow, and the
    offset (how far the shadow is away from each letter, in pixels) of the shadow.</p>
    <p>After this is an option where you can apply an outline to your font. Check the box if you want your font to have
    an outline around each letter. The two sliders allow you to change the "grayness" (black to white) of the outline,
    and the width of the outline (in pixels).</p>
    <p>Finally, there is a box where you can set the stage display's font size. If you are using a monitor to show
    lyrics to the praise team, for example, changing this will change the size of the words on that display.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Background Settings</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/background_settings.png">
    <p>The last part of the settings window allows you to set the global background and to choose a logo image.</p>
    <p>The first dropdown allows you to set a global background for all songs. To add a new background image to the
    program, scroll to the top of the dropdown and select "Import a Background Image." This will open a window where
    you can choose an image to bring into the program. All songs will use this background unless a custom background has
    been choosen in the advanced settings of that song's editor. Note that the images you import would ideally be the
    same size as your projector's display (i.e. 1920x1080) in order to avoid pixelation or distortion that would occur
    when fitting the image to the display.</p>
    <p>The next dropdown allows you to set a global background for all scripture passages. Adding a new background image
    is accomplished by choosing "Import a Background Image" from the top of the dropdown list.</p>
    <p>The third dropdown allows you to import or set a logo image that will be displayed when clicking the "Logo"
    button in the Main Window's Toolbar. The images shown in this dropdown are the same images stored in the "Images"
    tab of the media box and any images you import with this dropdown will also show in that "Images" tab.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Saving Settings</strong></p>
    <p>Finally, you have the "Save" and "Cancel buttons. Click "Save" to save and apply your changes, or click "Cancel"
    to undo your changes.</p>
