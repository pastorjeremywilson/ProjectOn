<body><h1>Importing/Exporting Songs</h1>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/import.png">
    <p>In addition to entering in songs by hand, ProjectOn can import a variety of song formats, accessed by choosing
    <strong>Import</strong> under the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>

    <p><strong>Import from OpenLP</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/import_openlp.png">
    <p>If you have used OpenLP in the past, you can import your whole song collection from OpenLP.</p>
    <p>Start by locating your OpenLP song database file. This can be done in one of two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Windows File Explorer</li>
        <li>Type "%appdata%" (without the quotes) at the top of explorer's window and press Enter</li>
        <li>Find and double-click the "openlp" folder</li>
        <li>Double-click the "data" folder</li>
        <li>Double-click the "songs" folder</li>
        <li>Here you will find the song database file, named "songs.sqlite"</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>or, if you were using the portable version of OpenLP</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Locate your OpenLP folder</li>
        <li>Double-click the "data" folder</li>
        <li>Double-click the "songs" folder</li>
        <li>Here you will find the song database file, named "songs.sqlite"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To keep your song data safe, copy this file to somewhere it can be easily accessed, like your desktop.</p>
    <p>Now, choose "Import Songs from OpenLP" from the File menu's Import sub-menu. In the window that shows, you
    can choose the copy of the <strong>songs.sqlite</strong> file you had made and begin the import.</p>

    <p><strong>Import from CCLI SongSelect</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/import_ccli.png">
    <p>If you have an account for CCLI's SongSelect service, you can import songs from their website.</p>
    <p>Start by choosing "Import Songs from CCLI SongSelect" from the File menu's Import sub-menu. If you haven't
    yet done so, you will be prompted to enter the user name and password you use for SongSelect. Doing so will
    encrypt and store your user name and password in order to automate the login process.</p>
    <p>Once you are logged in, use the website like normal to find the song you want to import. In order to import
    the song, click the "Download" icon under the "Lyrics" tab of SongSelect. ProjectOn will capture the download
    and import that song into your collection.</p>
    <p>Note: if you need to make any changes to your stored user name or password, choose "Save/Change CCLI SongSelect
    Password" from the "Tools" menu.</p>

    <p><strong>Import ChordPro or OpenLyrics Files</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/import_chordpro.svg">
    <p>If you have songs saved in either the ChordPro (*.txt *.crd *.chopro *.pro) or OpenLyrics (*.xml) file formats, </p>
    you can import them by choosing the appropriate action under the File menu's Import sub-menu.</p>
    <p>A window will first pop up asking if you would like to import a single song or import all the songs in a folder.
    Choose your desired action and click "OK". Then, a file browser will open where you can make your selection.</p>
    <p>If any errors occur when importing your file(s), you will be shown a dialog indicating so. To find out what went
    wrong, open the ChordPro or OpenLyrics file in a text editor (i.e. Notepad). Chances are that the error happened
    either because the file isn't actually one of these formats, or that the file is missing the "title" field. To
    check for the latter, examine the file contents and look to see if the title is missing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In <strong>ChordPro</strong>, the title field should look like
        <pre>
            {title: A Mighty Fortress}
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            In <strong>OpenLyrics</strong>, the title field should look like<br />
        <pre>
            &lt;titles&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;A Mighty Fortress&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/titles&gt;
        </pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If these title fields are missing, recreate them in the manner shown above and retry your import.</p>

    <p><strong>Export Songs as OpenLyrics Files</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/export.png" style="width: 300px;">
    <p>You can also export songs from your collection as OpenLyrics files. OpenLyrics is a standardized way of saving
    song lyrics, creating files that can be used by a wide variety of programs.</p>
    <p>To export songs, choose "Export" from the File menu. A window will show listing all the songs in your
    library. Here, you can choose individual songs to export, or select all of them. Once your songs are chosen, click
    "Export Songs". A file explorer window will open where you can choose the folder you want the songs to be saved
    to.</p>
