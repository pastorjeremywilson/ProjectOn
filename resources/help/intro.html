    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><strong>Thank-you for using ProjectOn!</strong></p>
    <p>The goal of this program is to provide an easy to use, fast, and customizable way to project lyrics, videos
    images, and other media during a worship service. Every effort has been made to create a user experience
    that is efficient and intuitive, but this help window will explain the ins and outs of this program.</p>
    <p>Use the tabs at the top of this window to view the different help topics.</p>
