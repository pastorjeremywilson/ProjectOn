    <h1>Edit Window</h1>

    <p>Choosing to edit a Song or Custom Slide will bring up an <strong>editing window</strong> where you can make 
	changes to that item's title, lyrics, text, etc.</p>
    <hr style="clear: both;">
    <p>To the very top of the editing window you will find a title line. This will be the title of the song or
    custom slide.</p>
    <p>If you are editing or creating a song, the next three lines will be for the Author, any copyright information
    associated with the song, and the number CCLI has assigned to this song (if the song comes from CCLI).</p>
    <p>Again, if you are editing a song, the next part contains buttons where you can insert "tags" dividing
    the song up into verses, chorus, bridge, etc. Using tags allows you to, for example, type a chorus in just once,
    but display it multiple times while the song is sung.</p>
    <p>Next is the lyric/text box. In here goes the lyrics for the song or the text you want your custom slide
    to say. Basic formatting functions are available for your text, namely Bold, Italic, and Underline. When using
    tags, all text underneath the tag belongs to that tag (up until the next tag or the end of the song). If you are
    not using tags, the program will automatically split the song wherever you have entered a blank line.</p>
    <p>If you are editing a song, you can enter in the order you want verses, choruses, etc. displayed. For example,
    if your song has four verses with a chorus following each verse, you would type in <strong>v1 c1 v2 c1 v3 c1 v4 c1
    </strong>. Separate each one with a space.</p>
    <hr style="clear: both;">
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/edit_advanced.png">
    <p>Clicking the "+" beside "Show Advanced Options" will show additional options you can apply to your song or
    Custom Slide</p>
    <p>By default, a song will display a footer showing the song's title, composer, any copyright info, and your
    CCLI license number, if you have one. To prevent this footer from showing, uncheck the box beside "Use Footer
    for this song."</p>
    <p>Songs and custom slides will automatically use the default (global) font settings you have set in the "Settings"
    window. However, if you want to override those settings for this particular song or custom slide, you can do so in
    the "Font Options" area. To change back to this item using the global defaults, simply choose "Use Global Font" for
    the Font Family, choose "Use Global Font Color" for the Font Color, and/or choose "Use Global Font Size" for the
    Font Size</p>
    <p>Songs and custom slides will automatically use the default (global) song background you have set in settings
    or in the toolbar. To override the global background and use a different image or solid color for just this song,
    You can do so in the "Background" area of Advanced Options. Clicking on "Solid Color" will bring up a Window 
	where you can choose a custom color, while clicking on "Image" will show a dropdown where you can choose your 
	image.</p>
    <p>Finally, you have the "Save" and "Cancel" buttons. Press "Save" to save your changes, or press "Cancel" to undo
    any changes you have made. Using the "X" at the top-right of the window is the same as pressing "Cancel."</p>
