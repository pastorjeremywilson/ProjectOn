    <h1>Edit Window</h1>

    <p>Choosing to edit a Song or Custom Slide will bring up an <strong>editing window</strong> where you can make 
	changes to that item's title, lyrics, text, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Editor Elements</strong></p>
    <p>To the very top of the editing window you will find a <strong>Title</strong> line. This will be the title of the song or
    custom slide.</p>
    <p>If you are editing or creating a song, the next three lines will be for the <strong>Author</strong>, any
    <strong>Copyright</strong> information associated with the song, and the number <strong>CCLI</strong> has
    assigned to this song (if the song comes from CCLI).</p>
    <p>Next is the <strong>lyric/text box</strong>. In here goes the lyrics for the song or the text you want your
    custom slide to say. Basic formatting functions are available for your text, namely Bold, Italic, and Underline.
    <br><i>When using tags, all text underneath the tag belongs to that tag (up until the next tag or the end of the
    song). If you are not using tags, the program will automatically split the song wherever you have entered a blank
    line.</i></p>
    <p>If you are editing a song, you can specify the order in which you want verses, choruses, etc. to be displayed.
    To the right of the lyrics, you will see a box labeled <strong>Segments</strong>. This box contains any <strong>tags
    </strong> you have put into your lyrics. Next to that is a box labeled <strong>Song Order</strong>. Simply
    drag-and-drop the song's segments in their correct order in the Song Order box. If you need to remove a segment
    from the song's order, click on it then press the Delete button on your keyboard.</p>
    <p>Again, if you are editing a song, the next part contains buttons where you can insert <strong>tags</strong>
    dividing the lyrics into verses, chorus, bridge, etc. Using tags allows you to, for example, type a chorus in just
    once but display it multiple times while the song is sung.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Advanced Options</strong></p>
    <img class="wrap" src="resources/help/edit_advanced.png" width="600px">
    <p>Clicking the "+" beside <strong>Show Advanced Options</strong> will show additional options you can apply to
    your song or Custom Slide</p>
    <p>By default, a song will display a <strong>footer</strong> showing the song's title, composer, any copyright info,
    and your CCLI license number, if you have one. To prevent this footer from showing, uncheck the box beside "Use
    Footer for this song."</p>
    <p>Songs and custom slides will automatically use the default (global) font settings and the default (global) song
    background you have set in the "Settings" window or in the Toolbar. However, if you want to override those settings
    for this particular song or custom slide, check the box that says <strong>Override Global Settings</strong>. Doing
    so will apply - to this song or custom slide only - whatever font options or background options you set in this
    "Advanced Options" area. To retun to using the global settings for this song/custom slide, simply uncheck the
    "Override Global Settings" checkbox.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>Finally, you have the <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons. Press "Save" to save your
    changes, or press "Cancel" to undo any changes you have made. Using the "X" at the top-right of the window is the
    same as pressing "Cancel."</p>
