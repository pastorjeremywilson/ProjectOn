# What Am I?

ProjectOn is an open-source multimedia projection program geared towards
producing and running church services.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Why ProjectOn?

Working in a smaller church, I was limited by a small budget, the small
number of open-source church projection programs available, and few
tech-savvy volunteers. ProjectOn seeks to provide an easy to use,
intuitive, and responsive experience when building and running the
projection needs of a church service.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

# What's New in Version 1.4.0?

- Global font for Song slides and Bible slides can now be set independently
from each other.
- Added a "Shade Behind Text" option to the font menu, allowing for a translucent
square to be shown behind the text. This can help readability on 'busy' backgrounds.
- Improved font preview now included in the toolbar font dropdowns.
- Font dropdowns now disappear when clicking outside of them (no longer
need to click the font button to make them go away).

# Installation

Currently, ProjectOn is available for the Microsoft Windows operating
system only. Download the current ProjectOn installer (v.1.3.3.024) and run
it on your computer.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Using ProjectOn

This information will get you started, but for more in-depth information
on using ProjectOn, please click “Help” and “Help Contents” in the menu.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Screen Layout

When you first run ProjectOn, you’ll be greeted with a screen split into
four main areas:

- Order of Service

- Media Storage

- Preview Panel

- Live Panel

The Order of Service area is where you will place the various items to
show during your service, such as music lyrics, bible verses, and
images. Drag-and-drop items into this area from the Media Storage area
or use the Media Storage’s Add to Service buttons. Drag items in the
Order of Service to rearrange their order.

In the Media Storage area, you will find tabs for the various types of
media that can be displayed:

- Song Lyrics

- Bible Verses

- Custom Slides

- Images

- Videos

- Web Slides

The Preview Panel shows you the content of what is coming up next in the
service, while the Live Panel shows you the content of what is currently
being displayed.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Remote Interfaces

The ProjectOn program, while it is running, creates a server that can be
accessed by any browser on any device connected to the same network or
access point. This server has three different web pages that can be
accessed:

- Remote Control

- Mobile-Friendly Remote Control

- Stage View

The Remote Control provides an application that allows you to control
the service through another device, such as a tablet or smartphone.

The Stage View shows a simplified version of any text that is currently
being displayed on the projector. This is particularly useful for
showing lyrics to a Praise Team.

The specific web pages for these can be found by choosing “Help” and
“About” from the menu.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Settings

There are various changes that can be made to how ProjectOn works. By
clicking on the settings icon, you will see what those changes are:

- CCLI Info

- Screen Settings

- Global Font Settings

- Global Background Settings

If you have an account with CCLI (Christian Copyright Licensing
International), you can enter your license number(s) here. This will
ensure that your license number appears on any lyrics shown on the
projector.

In the Screen Settings you can choose which screen you would like to use
as your display. By default, the program uses whatever monitor is
currently set up as your “Primary” monitor and, if a second monitor or
projector is already connected to the computer, uses that as the
display.

In the Global Font section, you can change the appearance of the text
that is being displayed. You’ll find options for the Font Face, Size,
Shadow, Outline, and Color of the text. Here, too, you can change the
size of the font that appears on the Stage View.

In the Global Background section you can choose the default background
for songs and for bible passages. These changes can also be made in the
toolbar at the top of the main window. Songs and bible verses will
automatically used these backgrounds, unless you specify a custom
background to use when editing a song.

Here, too, you can choose a custom “Logo” image to display when nothing
else is being shown; for example, a graphic with a welcome message.
